### Introduction

This repository contains 3 other files:
1. run_analysis.R
2. tidy_data.txt
3. CodeBook.md

##### 1. run_analysis.R

The R code in this file does the following:
1. Merge the training data and test data to create one data set
2. Extract measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set from step 4 with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

##### 2. tidy_data.txt

This is the output file from run_analysis.R that contains the average of each variable for each subject and each activity.

##### 3. CodeBook.md

This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
